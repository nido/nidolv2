Nido's lv2 filters

not much yet

to make ./configure, run: mkdir m4; autoreconf -si
mkdir is needed because libtool is set up to put stuff there and thus configure.ac expects the directory to exists

maintainer requirements:
autoconf-archive
libtool


To those who really care about memory usage:
This plugin makes use of fftw3 in order to do fourier transformations.
In order to truly reclaim all memory used, at the end of it all i should
run fftwf_cleanup() to make sure everything of fftw is properly cleaned up.
However, as it turns out, running that function crashes practically every
DAW i tested. I assume DAW's somehow found an use for fftw3, so cleaning up
their plans from under their noses seems like a bad idea.
So if you want to be sure you reclaim everything and use my plugin, be sure
to run fftw_cleanup() afterwards
